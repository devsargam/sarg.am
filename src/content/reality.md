The honest truth I've realized about life after living for almost 20 years.

    

To get anything you will have to fight rentlessly over and over again and make a lot of hard or stupid(what people think) decisions. Most of the time the people who seem the most close to you are exploiting you the most.

    

Almost all the information that you get for free on the internet is either fake or you are being brainwashed and sold.

    
Power is what all the humans fight for. Be it a rich man or a country fighting against other. This makes sense because everything happens with/for power. Example, our body needs power/energy at a fundamenal level to even just function properly.

    
Always believing you are a beginner at everything and never being afraid of failing is what improves you. There's literally no shortcut to being sucessful in life if you don't try everything and understand what works and what not.

    
Ability to afford liberty and think clearly is a blessing not a lot of people receive. If you have an oppotrunity to do what your guts tell you to do. JUST DO IT!
